## Obligatorio1_2014: Mathematical Modeling of Incentive Policies in P2P Systems

In order to stimulate cooperation among nodes in P2P systems, some form of incentive mechanism is necessary so as to encourage service contribution. Hence, designing and evaluating the stability, robustness and performance of incentive policies is extremely critical.

The paper with all the details for the model is included here: https://github.com/vallejos/fing-metnum/blob/master/Mathematical%20Modeling%20of%20Incentive%20Policies%20in%20P2P%20Systems.pdf

In part 1 of the implementation, the problem is expressed and solved using a Proportional Incentive Policy, for cooperators, reciprocators and defectors peers.

For part 2, a Image Incentive Policy is considered and the problem is solved using Euler Method and the Trapezoidal Rule.

## Obligatorio2_2014: Image Compression using SVD

In this project we use the SVD (Single Value Decomposition) to study the different compressions levels for an image.

The implemented algorithm is the Golub-Kahan-Reinsch Algorithm presented in [GOLUB2013] or [QUARTERONI2007]. A demonstration for the [GOLUB2013] algorithm is also included.

Finally, a few tests are run to reconstruct the image using different singular values in order to obtain the requested MSE quality.
